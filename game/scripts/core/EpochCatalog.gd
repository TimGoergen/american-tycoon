class_name EpochCatalog

# The fixed table of EPOCHS — the alien-contact eras that staffing is now keyed to
# (see Plans/Epoch_Staffing_System.md). A pure DATA TABLE in code, the same shape as
# LegacyUpgradeCatalog.gd: static, stateless, no scene tree.
#
# The single currency stays Earth dollars. An epoch is flavor + a magnitude gate +
# a staff tier:
#   - Each epoch has a *total economic value* — the dollars that economy is worth.
#     Earth's is the existing Earth target (~$103.6T). Once a generation has EARNED
#     that whole value, it has "consumed" the economy and makes contact with the next
#     civilization, opening the next (orders-of-magnitude larger) epoch (GDD §10 / Tim
#     2026-06-16). That climb is what justifies the economy reaching absurd scales.
#   - Each epoch unlocks a new STAFFER TIER for every property: an alien-tech upgrade
#     over the previous staffer that multiplies that property's income. Tier 1 = Earth
#     (multiplier 1.0 — just enables automation, matching old behavior); tiers 2+ are
#     the large alien jumps.
#
# Tiers are 1-based. Index 0 of the array is tier 1 (Earth). The Earth economy value is
# NOT stored here — it is sourced from TuningConfig.earth_economy_target and scaled by
# `economy_scale` so the win/contact threshold has a single source of truth.
#
# v1 ships Earth + 3 alien races (Plans doc §8). Numbers are first-pass, meant for
# on-device feel-tuning, not final balance; the dynasty sim verifies "speeds up every
# time" still holds with them.


# Each epoch is one dictionary with these keys:
#   tier               — 1-based era number, also the property staff_tier it unlocks
#   civilization       — display name of the race Earth is trading with
#   home_planet        — flavor, shown on the first-contact screen
#   currency_flavor    — that civilization's currency name (flavor only; we stay in $)
#   economy_scale      — that economy's total value as a MULTIPLE of Earth's economy.
#                        Earth = 1; consuming `earth_target × economy_scale` dollars of
#                        lifetime earnings advances OUT of this epoch into the next.
#   staff_income_multiplier — income multiplier a property gets while staffed at this tier
#   hire_cost_multiplier    — multiplies the base hire cost when hiring/upgrading to this
#                             tier (alien talent costs more)
#   staffer_names      — the staffer title shown per property, indexed 0–11 in GDD §4 order
